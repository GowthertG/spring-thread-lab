# üßµ spring-thread-lab

A mini Spring Boot project to explore and demonstrate threading concepts including `@Async`, `@Scheduled`, `CompletableFuture`, executor configuration, and more.

---


## üöÄ Features Covered

This project helps understand and compare:
- High-level async programming in Spring Boot (`@Async`)
- Task tracking with `CompletableFuture` and status endpoints
- Manual task cancellation using `Future.cancel()`
- Task timeouts using `CompletableFuture.orTimeout(...)`
- Exception handling in `@Async` methods
- Periodic execution with `@Scheduled`
- Manual thread creation using native Java (`Thread`, `Runnable`, `Executor`)
- Thread pool configuration and graceful shutdown
